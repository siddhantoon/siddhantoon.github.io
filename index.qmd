Hi, I'm **Siddhant** 👋

This blog is my space to *learn in public* — to share what I discover and connect with others on a similar path.
If you're into (or wanna get into) **Deep Learning**, **LLMs**, or **Python**, you're in the right place.

I currently work as a **Data Scientist-II** at **Wolters Kluwer**. Over the past 3 years, I've been building and scaling intelligent pipelines in the **Document AI** space — processing unstructured documents. Recently, building systems around **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and smart search.

On the side, I've freelanced as a **Python dev** and **AI engineer** — sharpening my programming skills and gaining a broad view of how AI projects come together end to end.

Before AI fever, I was deep into **robotics** 🤖 — experimenting in simulation and occasionally with real hardware (when someone sponsored). That path eventually led me into **computer vision**, where I worked with both classical algorithms and deep nn models like **YOLO**, **ResNets**, and **GANs**.

These days, I'm focused on learning **transformers** and **LLM architectures** in depth. Alongside, exploring **Kaggle competitions** to stay hands-on and push my thinking through experimentation.

If you're curious about **NLP**, **LLMs**, **document intelligence**, or building **scalable AI systems** — I'd love to connect.

👉 Available for **freelance or consulting** in AI/ML, Document Intelligence, or RAG-based systems — feel free to reach out.

🚀 Up for teaming on **Kaggle or hackathons**? Ping me on Discord — always down to learn together.
